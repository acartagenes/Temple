# Temple Art

Unfortunatley my project became much larger than Github can process. (Over 400MB) It is being hosted using ngrok and with the Live Server still online from VSCODE  http://e084a4e184f8.ngrok.io/TempleArt.html


I am adding my code so that you can see it, none of the folders unfortunetly will load because they are also way to big.
